When doing nothing, I do this. 

DOD: 
- Backend written in Go
- Use AWS services available from code quality, deployment, to hosting
- Use Elasticache in AWS or find a free Redis Service
- Testing

Challenging myself: 
- Zero Experience in Golang
- I actually forgot how to AWS
- Frontend to be written using NextJS/ React with Redux for SSR
